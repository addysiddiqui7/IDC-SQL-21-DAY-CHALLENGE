Pizza Analytics Challenge - IDC 21 days challenge - Mini project

## Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts and queries for analyzing the Pizza Sales dataset.  
The goal is to practice joins, aggregations, and advanced SQL concepts using a real-world dataset.

These tables are linked through foreign keys and allow exploration of sales, categories, and pricing.

## Queries
Examples included:
- Total order value per order
- Categories with more than 5,000 pizzas sold
- Pizzas never ordered
- Price differences between different sizes of the same pizza
